/**
 * Custom hook for tracking the currently focused form field in real-time.
 *
 * This hook provides real-time tracking of which form field is currently focused
 * as the user navigates through the form. Unlike draft restoration focus logic,
 * this tracks actual user interaction and updates dynamically.
 *
 * **Key Features:**
 * - Tracks focus changes in real-time as user navigates
 * - Works with any form field (name, description, color1, color2, etc.)
 * - Updates immediately when user clicks or tabs between fields
 * - Provides both the current focused field and focus change handlers
 * - Independent of draft values or form restoration
 *
 * **Use Cases:**
 * - Determining which color field is active for color picker operations
 * - Providing context-sensitive actions based on current field
 * - Real-time UI updates based on focus state
 * - Debugging and development logging
 *
 * @returns Object containing:
 * - `currentFocusedField`: String ID of currently focused field or null
 * - `setFocusedField`: Function to manually set the focused field
 * - `createFocusHandlers`: Function to create onFocus/onBlur handlers for form fields
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Basic usage
 * const { currentFocusedField, createFocusHandlers } = useRealTimeFocus();
 *
 * // Check if a color field is focused
 * const isColorFieldFocused = currentFocusedField?.startsWith('color');
 *
 * // Create handlers for a form field
 * const colorFieldHandlers = createFocusHandlers('color1');
 *
 * // Use with Raycast Form.TextField
 * <Form.TextField
 *   {...itemProps.color1}
 *   onFocus={colorFieldHandlers.onFocus}
 *   onBlur={colorFieldHandlers.onBlur}
 * />
 * ```
